>abbreviations i use and what i mean by them ! :
```
dni : do not interact ! ; i dont use this very often but when i do , im either upset or just low on energy and would not liked to be approached . [ note that friends / party are the ONLY exception to this , even when not specified . ]
sv : semi - verbal ! ; i dont put this on very much but you can tell if i am semi - verbal based on my lack of replies . when i am sv its because im either drained , feeling out of place , or busy .
nv : non - verbal ! ; again , i dont put this on but you'll be able to tell i am nv if i dont reply verbally for awhile . ^
[ + ] offline : i like to put this on sometimes when im with party / a group of friends [ or non friends ] and dont want to be approached by anyone else unless i interacted with you first [ this status applies to friends only btw ] . but if i have the status and im alone , feel free to approach . either i forgot to turn the status off or i want to hide .
