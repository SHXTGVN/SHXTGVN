>abbreviations i use and what i mean by them ! :
```
dni : do not interact ! ; i dont use this very often but when i do , im either upset or just low on energy and would not liked to be approached . [ note that friends / party are the ONLY exception to this , even when not specified . ]
sv : semi - verbal ! ; i dont put this on very much but you can tell if i am semi - verbal based on my lack of replies . when i am sv its because im either drained , feeling out of place , or busy .
nv : non - verbal ! ; again , i dont put this on but you'll be able to tell i am nv if i dont reply verbally for awhile . ^
[ + ] offline : if you see me in game but i have my status offline , then do NOT approach me at all . i have that on only when im with kouski .
